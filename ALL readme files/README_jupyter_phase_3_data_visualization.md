## phase 3>DATA VISUALIZATION 
#### OBJECTIVES FOR ANALYSIS
#### 1.Create Visualizations
#### Using the columns identified during the data analysis phase,I'll generate insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.
#### 1.Aircraft Type Analysis: A count chart showing the count of incidents by aircraft type.
#### 2.Seasonal Analysis: A l bar chart displaying the number of incidents across different seasons.
#### 3.Location Analysis: A bar chart illustrating the frequency of incidents in various locations.
#### 4.Phase of Flight Risk Analysis: A bar chart showing incidents by phase of flight.
#### 5.Weather Condition Analysis: A bar chart depicting incidents under different weather conditions.
#### 6.Human Risk Analysis: A stacked bar chart displaying the severity of incidents (fatal, serious, minor injuries) by aircraft type.
#### OBJECTIVES FOR ANALYSIS
#### 1.Aircraft Type Analysis: Determine which aircraft types have the highest and lowest incident rates. This will help in deciding the best aircraft type for the company to invest in.
#### 2.Seasonal Analysis: Identify the safest and riskiest seasons for operations. This will inform strategic planning for seasonal operations.
#### 3.Location Analysis: Find the safest and most hazardous locations for operations. This will guide decisions on where to focus or avoid operations.
#### 4.Phase of Flight Risk Analysis: Assess which phases of flight are most prone to incidents.
#### 5.Weather Condition Analysis: Identify weather conditions that correlate with higher incident rates.
#### 6.Human Risk Analysis: Evaluate which aircraft types pose the greatest risk to human life. This will influence safety measures and investment decisions.
