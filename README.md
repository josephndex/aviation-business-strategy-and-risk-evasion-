## phase 3>DATA VISUALIZATION 
#### OBJECTIVES 
#### 1.Create Visualizations
#### Using the columns identified during the data analysis phase,I'll generate insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.
#### 1.Aircraft Type Analysis: A count chart showing the count of incidents by aircraft type.
#### 2.Seasonal Analysis: A l bar chart displaying the number of incidents across different seasons.
#### 3.Location Analysis: A bar chart illustrating the frequency of incidents in various locations.
#### 4.Phase of Flight Risk Analysis: A bar chart showing incidents by phase of flight.
#### 5.Weather Condition Analysis: A bar chart depicting incidents under different weather conditions.
#### 6.Human Risk Analysis: A stacked bar chart displaying the severity of incidents (fatal, serious, minor injuries) by aircraft type.
#### OBJECTIVES FOR ANALYSIS
#### 1.Aircraft Type Analysis: Determine which aircraft types have the highest and lowest incident rates. This will help in deciding the best aircraft type for the company to invest in.
#### 2.Seasonal Analysis: Identify the safest and riskiest seasons for operations. This will inform strategic planning for seasonal operations.
#### 3.Location Analysis: Find the safest and most hazardous locations for operations. This will guide decisions on where to focus or avoid operations.
#### 4.Phase of Flight Risk Analysis: Assess which phases of flight are most prone to incidents.
#### 5.Weather Condition Analysis: Identify weather conditions that correlate with higher incident rates.
#### 6.Human Risk Analysis: Evaluate which aircraft types pose the greatest risk to human life. This will influence safety measures and investment decisions.

## phase 4> Data analysis and recommendations:
#### 1.Aircraft Accidents by Category and Damage Type:Airplanes are the most prone to accidents, with substantial damage incidents reaching up to 20,000. This highlights a significant risk factor for airplane operations.
#### 2.Categories Less Prone to Accidents:Gliders, Balloons, Gyrocraft, Ultralight, Blimps, Powered-Lift, Weight-Shift, Powered Parachute, Rocket, WSFT, and ULTR are less prone to accidents. These categories show lower incident rates and may present safer investment options.
#### 3.Engine Type Risk:Aircraft with reciprocating engines are more prone to accidents. This finding underscores the importance of considering engine type in safety assessments and investment decisions.
#### 4.Aircraft Incidents by Season:The number of planes destroyed remains relatively constant across all seasons, indicating that certain types of damage are not heavily influenced by seasonal variations.
#### 5.Increased Risk in Summer:There is a notable increase in incidents during the summer, suggesting that flying conditions or operational factors in this season may contribute to a higher risk.
#### 6.Recommendation for Light Aircraft:For light aircraft operations, flying during autumn is advisable as it presents more favorable conditions. Autumn is the second-best performing season, offering a balance between operational efficiency and safety.
#### 7.Winter Operations for Panes:The lower incident rates during this time indicate more stable and predictable flying conditions.
#### 8.Based on the graph of Count of Aircraft Incidents by Location and Damage Type for the top 10 airports, I identified the top 3 locations with incident counts below 40:
#### Atlanta
#### Las Vegas
#### San Antonio
#### 9.Risk Assessment by Flight Phase:Analysis of the graph showing Count of Aircraft Incidents by Broad Phase of Flight and Damage Type reveals that the landing and takeoff phases pose the highest risk
#### 10.High-Risk Phases:The data indicates that incidents are more frequent during the landing and takeoff phases compared to other phases of flight.
#### 11.Weather Condition and Incident Analysis:The graph of Count of Aircraft Incidents by Weather Condition and Damage Type highlights that Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) are associated with the highest number of incidents. 
#### 12.Injury and Safety Comparison:The analysis of the graphs reveals that airplanes have the highest number of injured people. However, they also account for the highest number of uninjured individuals. This duality indicates that while airplanes are involved in more incidents, a significant proportion of these incidents result in no injuries.
#### 13.Profitability vs. Risk:Given the data, airplanes appear to be the most lucrative aircraft type. They offer substantial potential for profitability but also come with a considerable amount of risk due to the high number of incidents.
## Concrete Business Recommendations:
### After analyzing the data here are the recommendations i came up with
#### 1.Initial Focus on Lightweight Crafts:Start operations with lightweight aircraft such as gliders, ultralights, and powered parachutes. These have shown lower incident rates, offering a safer entry into the market.
#### 2.Gradual Expansion:Once the company has established safe and efficient operations with lightweight crafts, it can gradually expand to larger aircraft. This phased approach will allow the company to build up expertise and manage risks effectively.
#### 3.Continual Risk Assessment:Implement ongoing monitoring and risk assessment strategies to identify and mitigate potential hazards. This will help maintain high safety standards and support informed decision-making.
#### 4.Training and Safety Protocols:Invest in comprehensive training programs for pilots and crew, focusing on the unique challenges associated with different aircraft types and phases of flight.
#### 5.Future Plane Investments:If the company decides to invest in planes in the future, it should avoid those with reciprocating engines due to their higher accident rates. Opting for aircraft with safer engine types will mitigate risks.
#### 6.Optimal Seasonal Operations:Light Aircraft: Focus operations in autumn for reduced risk and favorable conditions.>Planes: Prioritize winter operations for enhanced safety and minimized risk of incidents.
#### 7.Seasonal Risk Management:Implement stricter safety protocols and monitoring during summer months to mitigate the increased risk of incidents.
#### 8.I recommend the company consider these locations(Atlanta,Las Vegas,San Antonio) for their startups due to their relatively low incident rates. These locations provide a safer operational environment, which is crucial for a new venture aiming to minimize risks and ensure smooth operations.By strategically choosing locations with lower incident rates, the company can focus on establishing a robust operational foundation while maintaining a high standard of safety.
#### 9.Airport Path Condition:Conduct thorough and regular assessments of airport runways and taxiways to ensure they are in optimal condition. This includes checking for any potential hazards, ensuring proper maintenance, and implementing safety measures.
#### 9.Skilled Pilot Recruitment:Prioritize the recruitment and training of pilots who have proven expertise in handling takeoff and landing maneuvers. Implement advanced training programs and continuous skill enhancement sessions to keep pilots well-prepared for these critical phases.
#### 10.Enhanced Safety Protocols:Develop and enforce stringent safety protocols specifically designed for the takeoff and landing phases. This could include procedural checklists, advanced simulation training, and real-time monitoring systems to detect and respond to potential issues quickly.
#### 11.Avoid VMC for Lightweight Aircraft:Strategically plan flight operations to avoid VMC, especially when operating lightweight crafts. Consider alternative weather conditions that provide a safer flying environment.
#### 12.Training and Preparedness:Ensure that pilots and crew are well-trained to handle various weather conditions. Special emphasis should be placed on managing flights in non-VMC conditions to enhance overall safety.
### By following these recommendations, the company can optimize its operational strategy, balancing profitability with safety, and ensuring sustainable growth over time.
